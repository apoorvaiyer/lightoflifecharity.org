                            <h4>Bhagyashree Wavare</h4>
                            <p>One of Anando's most successful beneficiaries, Bhagyashree, a single parent child lives with her mother and younger sister in Alibaug. The financial strain fell on her mother who worked as a domestic help and sold flowers at the local temple.  Bhagyashree was in school when Anando intercepted and took her under its wing as they felt that poverty would force her mother to pull her out of school. Over the next three years, Bhagyashree emerged from her shell to be a confident and intelligent girl who harboured aspirations of being an air hostess. Supported by her mother and LOLT, her mother took a bank loan for her to enrol in Frankfinn Air hostess training programme, which she cleared with flying colours.</p>
                            <p>But with the recession hitting the aviation industry, job prospects were bleak. This didn't weaken her resolve to be financially secure, and she soon secured a job on her own merit as a junior executive at Merchant Gymkhana - managed by Mahalaxmi Foodlinks in Navi Mumbai at a salary of Rs 7000/- a month.</p>
                            <p>She is currently working with Welspun as Officer, General affairs at a salary of Rs 18000/- per month, and is supporting her mother and sister. Bhagyashree is a beacon of hope to all in her village and has also taken on the responsibility of repaying the loan.</p>

                            <h4>SarikaTukaram Zomate</h4>
                            <p>Born in a locality where there is zero importance given to education, especially that of a girl child, Sarika’s family unit is her mentally disturbed mother and two elder brothers. While one brother Avinash is married and runs a tea stall, the other stays with an uncle in Talegoan. Surviving on Avinash’s earnings, things had become difficult for the family after their father passed away due to liver failure. Sarika harboured aspirations of being a nurse and with the intervention of the Trust, this dream is close to becoming a reality. After completing her 12th grade, she was granted admission at the WIT Nursing Institute in Panvel. All the while running the house, as her mother is not capable.</p>
                            <p>At present she has enrolled for the MC-CIT Course at the JeevanAsha Community Centre.</p>

                            <h4>Swapnali Vishnu Turde,</h4>
                            <p>Being a girl seemed to be Swapnali’s only fault, as her parents thought that this was reason enough for her not to continue her education.</p>
                            <p>With a father who earned a basic wage doing wielding work and a housewife mother, Swapnali and her siblings—two sisters and one brother—were well settled in school. But as the financial strain of educating four children build up, the family put pressure on Swapnali to drop out so she too could work. Even their neighbours were in agreement as most of them didn’t believe in educating their girls.</p>
                            <p>After becoming a beneficiary of the Trust, there has been a change in Swapnali’s personality. Her confidence levels have been boosted along with her communication skills and decision making abilities.  She set a goal to become a teacher and steadily worked her way to a degree in teaching—she passed the D.T.ed with 73%.fromNavjeevan Education Society’s, (D.T.ed College) Dahivali- Malegaon, Neral.</p>
                            <p>Taking on the mantle of a teacher, she now works with the LOLT, empowering children and sharing her example with them. She plans to continue studying and expanding her knowledge base.</p>
